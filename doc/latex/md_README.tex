This is a c++ library to contain all the general-\/purpose data structures and algorithms that I use in my other projects.

{\bfseries Data structures included\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Gap Vector
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Build Instructions}

So far, you don\textquotesingle{}t need to build this library, just include the header file you need in your code.

To run tests, cd to the root of the project and run\+: ``` ./gradlew debugtestexecutable ./gradlew test ```
